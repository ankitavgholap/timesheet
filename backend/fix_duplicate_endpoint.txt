# Replace the DUPLICATE registration endpoint around line 371 with this comment:

# REMOVED DUPLICATE - Using the fixed version below

# Keep only the working registration endpoint at the bottom of your file (around line 461)
# That one uses existing table structure and should work fine.

# The issue is you have TWO @app.post("/api/register-developer") endpoints:
# 1. Line ~371: The broken one trying to use developer_id (DELETE THIS ONE)
# 2. Line ~461: The working one using existing table structure (KEEP THIS ONE)

# FastAPI is using the FIRST one it finds, which is the broken one.
