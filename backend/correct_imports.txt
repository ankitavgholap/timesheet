# CORRECT FIX for your main.py

# WRONG (what you probably did):
# from sqlalchemy.orm import Session, text  # ❌ text is not in sqlalchemy.orm

# CORRECT - Add this as a separate import line:
from sqlalchemy import text
import requests

# Your imports should look like this:
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session  # ← Keep this as is
from sqlalchemy import text  # ← Add this NEW line
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from typing import List, Optional
import requests  # ← Add this NEW line
from stateless_webhook import router as stateless_router
import uvicorn
# ... rest of your existing imports
