# üìä Timesheet Application - Complete Documentation

## üéØ What This Application Does

This is an **intelligent timesheet system** that automatically tracks your computer activity using ActivityWatch and calculates meaningful work metrics. It goes beyond simple time tracking by analyzing **what** you're doing and determining how much of that time is actually productive work.

## üî¢ Understanding Your Numbers

### Daily Breakdown Explained

When you see values like:
- **0.59h** of 0.62h total (95.3% productive)
- **1.02h** of 2.4h total (42.6% productive)

Here's what they mean:

#### **Working Hours (0.59h, 1.02h)**
This is the **calculated productive work time** based on intelligent analysis of your activities. Not all computer time is work time!

#### **Total Hours (0.62h, 2.4h)**
This is the **raw time tracked** by ActivityWatch - every second your computer was active.

#### **Productivity Percentage (95.3%, 42.6%)**
This is **Working Hours √∑ Total Hours √ó 100** - showing what percentage of your computer time was actually productive.

#### **Activities Count (56, 131)**
This is the **number of individual activities** tracked - every app switch, window change, or website visit counts as one activity.

## üßÆ How Working Hours Are Calculated

The system uses **smart category-based weighting** to determine productive time:

### Category Weights

| Category | Weight | Examples | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Development** | 100% | VS Code, Cursor, PyCharm, IntelliJ | All coding time is work |
| **Database** | 100% | DataGrip, pgAdmin, SQL tools | All database work is productive |
| **Productivity** | 100% | Office apps, Slack, Teams, Notion | All productivity tools are work |
| **Browser** | 85% | Chrome, Firefox, Safari | Most browsing is work-related (docs, research) |
| **Other** | Smart Analysis | Various apps | Intelligent per-app analysis |
| **System** | 10% | File Explorer, Task Manager | Minimal productivity value |
| **Entertainment** | 0% | Spotify, YouTube, Netflix | Not work time |

### Smart Analysis for "Other" Category

The system intelligently analyzes unknown applications:

```python
if 'lockapp' in app.lower():
    work_time = app_time * 0.9  # 90% work time
elif 'datagrip' in app.lower() or 'postman' in app.lower():
    work_time = app_time * 1.0  # 100% work time  
elif 'snipping' in app.lower():
    work_time = app_time * 0.9  # 90% work time
else:
    work_time = app_time * 0.5  # 50% work time (conservative)
```

## üìà Status Color Coding

Your daily hours are color-coded based on productivity:

- üü¢ **GREEN (Excellent)**: 8+ working hours
- üü° **YELLOW (Good)**: 6-8 working hours  
- üî¥ **RED (Low)**: Less than 6 working hours

## üîç What Gets Tracked

### Activity Records
Every activity record contains:

- **Application Name**: The program you were using
- **Window Title**: What was displayed in the window
- **Duration**: How long you spent (in seconds)
- **Timestamp**: When the activity occurred
- **Category**: Automatically assigned category
- **URL**: For browser activities, the website visited
- **File Path**: For development, the file you were editing

### Example Activity Record
```json
{
  "application_name": "Cursor.exe",
  "window_title": "backend/main.py - timesheet",
  "duration": 180,
  "timestamp": "2025-09-15T10:30:00Z",
  "category": "development",
  "file_path": "E:/timesheet/backend/main.py"
}
```

## üìä Sample Calculations

### Example Day Analysis

**Raw Data:**
- Chrome: 45 minutes (browser category)
- VS Code: 120 minutes (development category)  
- Slack: 15 minutes (productivity category)
- YouTube: 30 minutes (entertainment category)

**Calculation:**
```
Chrome:   45 min √ó 0.85 = 38.25 min working time
VS Code: 120 min √ó 1.00 = 120.00 min working time  
Slack:    15 min √ó 1.00 = 15.00 min working time
YouTube:  30 min √ó 0.00 = 0.00 min working time

Total Time: 210 minutes (3.5 hours)
Working Time: 173.25 minutes (2.89 hours)
Productivity: 82.5%
```

## üöÄ Usage Tips

### 1. **Interpreting Your Data**
- High activity count usually means task switching
- Low productivity % might indicate distraction or breaks
- Consistent 8+ hour days show good work habits

### 2. **Improving Productivity**
- Focus on longer sessions in development tools
- Minimize entertainment during work hours
- Use the data to identify distraction patterns

### 3. **Data Accuracy**
- The system learns from your patterns
- Manual categorization overrides are possible
- Regular ActivityWatch sync ensures fresh data

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Low Working Hours Despite Feeling Productive**
   - Check if your main work apps are properly categorized
   - Browser time is weighted at 85% (not 100%)
   - System/background apps have low productivity weights

2. **High Activity Count**
   - This is normal - every window switch counts
   - Indicates multitasking or frequent app switching
   - Not necessarily bad, just different work style

3. **Missing Time**
   - Ensure ActivityWatch is running continuously
   - Check for computer sleep/hibernate periods
   - Verify ActivityWatch permissions

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Machine Learning**: Learn personal productivity patterns
2. **Goal Setting**: Set daily/weekly hour targets
3. **Team Analytics**: Compare productivity across team members
4. **Custom Categories**: User-defined application categories
5. **Time Blocking**: Integration with calendar systems
